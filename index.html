                  Building designers are the professionals that design houses
                  and small buildings. Most single-family dwellings are designed
                  by a building designer. There are limits to what a building
                  designer can design that determines if an architect is needed.

                  Zoning regulations are bylaws from the city that add
                  parameters on the project. They determine things like where
                  you can build and how much space you can take up on the
                  property, how high you can build, and other specifics. Zoning
                  regulations are things that the building designer ensures your
                  project conforms to during the design process.

                  Yes, floor plans are fun to make and there’s tons of different

                  laying out the floors does not mean the design is nearly done.
                  The designer’s job is to make sure the floor plans work, both
                  structurally and with proper space planning and flow patterns.
                  Also, floor plans are a part of the whole design and work in
                  tandem with the roof, elevations, grades, decks, stairs, other
                  floors, and so on. It all needs to come together for a
                  functioning design.

                  For the vast majority of projects, the answer is yes. With

                  ensures the structure is designed and built adequately and
                  correctly inspected. Without a building permit, how will the

                  followed? The safest and most secure way to go about your

                  viewing. The departments will either make comments and
                  requests for additional items, or they will pass the plans.
                  Once the building permit application is approved, you are able
                  to start construction.

                  Construction documents are what the city requires for building

                  buildings, an architect is needed when the building is more
                  than 4 dwelling units, is over 3 stories in height, or is

                  structural integrity of the building. A good building designer
                  will ensure the structural elements affecting the design are
                  laid out so they doesn’t disturb the intent of the design.
                  However, the structural engineer is the person ensuring the
                  structural members and seismic bracings are adequate.

                  Surveyors survey the property and provide a drawing that
                  accurately plots the lot, any buildings on the lot, the
                  street, services, curbs, utility poles, etc. They also provide
                  specific heights of the land, an important item for
                  determining the height of the building. Land surveyors ensure
                  the house is built where it is supposed to be built at time of
                  construction and make sure heights are followed during
                  construction.
